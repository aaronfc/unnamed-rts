## Tasks

## Pipeline
- [X] Game Over scenes completion:
	- Add best score. ✔️ 
	- Add custom message based on result. ✔️ 
	- Maybe some restyling? ✔️ 
- [X] Menu scene completion:
	- Add the game name ✔️ 
- [X] 🎉 0.2 version completed! - Less annoying!
- [ ] 🧠 Document what the 0.3 version (aka pathfinding) will be.
- [X] Try https://github.com/amaccann/phaser-navmesh-generation with an empty tilemap (empty collisions array also) - check example and use the addSprite method.
	- ⚠️  We are having errors just by importing the plugin. - Need to check 
	- Seems like not useful for us because it was implemented for phaser-ce
- [X] Consider creating navmesh manually (or with an unknown plugin) and use: https://www.mikewesthad.com/navmesh/docs/#creating-a-navigation-mesh
	- [X] Generate the navmesh
	- [X] Display the navmesh in some kind of debug
	- [X] Test that findPath method returns a correct set of points
- [.] Integrating Pathfinding
	- [X] Make villagers follow a path when commanding to move somewhere
	- ⚠️  Path is not optimal at all for some cases. Seems like it might be related with the heuristic being used by the library we are using. It's calculating distance from centroids which, for some cases with really big squares it seems not to make sense.
	- [ ] Make villagers use pathfinding for moving from and to a resource
	- [ ] Same for enemies
	- [ ] Update the navigational mesh when adding new entities.
	- [ ] Special case: removing buildings or resources
	- [ ] Special case: buildings or resources in multiple quadrants (2, 3, 4?)
	- [ ] Special case: building overriding one or more quadrants
- [ ] 🐛 While collecting resource sometimes entities keep collecting even though they were commanded to move. Probably there's a moment when they will just ignore the move command - check the collecting behaviour.
- [ ] 🐛 When moving a group of entities. Because of collisions between them they will eventually get stuck trying to get as closest as possible to one point of the path.
- [ ] Keep investigating solutions for pathfinding (get tasks from dev-notes)
- [.] Research design possibilities for the game:
	- [.] Check on free assets to add some basic styling to the game.
		- [X] Identify assets that we really need:
			- Grass
			- Town center (big house / castle / camp)
			- Resource (rocks tinted to pink or something similar?)
			- Houses (for 0.4)
		- [ ] What size should the assets be? Tilemap sizing?
		- [ ] Get some assets
	- [ ] Check on fonts and buttons/icons.
- [ ] Revamp game-over screen style
- [ ] Look into a proper Events manager. We need a way to remove all the listener for a given entity.
- [ ] 🐛 Zooming / blurry on Firefox
- [ ] 🐛 Pause time when game is paused (changing to different tab)
- [ ] 🐛 Timer delay (already workarounded but after moving preload to separate scene maybe it's fixed)
- [ ] Document: Github Pages
- [ ] 🐛 villager-icon key already in use - Fix: Move all images loading to a booting scene
- [ ] Study alternatives to accessing Scene's data directly from, for example, GameOverSceen. Scene Registry?
- [ ] Keep score leader board or similar
- [ ] 💡 Make the "Next wave coming in 10 seconds" update the message every second @Chris2A
- [ ] Villager refactor: Extract status to Tasks
- [ ] Randomly generate map. - Main building position and resources. - Document that in the [game document][1].
- [ ] Add "scenes" to the game. - Loading screen. - Main menu - Game (everything done until now)

## Done

- [x] Extract building to a separate class
- [x] Check if `.update()` has to be manually called or it's already called by adding the GameObject to the scene. - We need it!
- [x] Migrate "movement" to a "walking-to-position" status.
- [x] Refactor: Generify the walking to "somewhere" behaviour. - Yes, we did it but only the first phase.
- [x] Resource depletion. - Resource representation: for the moment play with opacity. - When empty, resource should be destroyed. - Implement logic on villagers for when Resource is destroyed.
- [x] Make game bigger for stream
- [x] GUI - Create "Game Counters / Score" - Number of villagers - Game time - Amount of resource
- [x] Make GUI more fancy - Text is blurry because of the canvas manual resizing done in index.html - Time needs to be formatted properly so that we have minutes and hours - Increase depth level so that GUI is over the rest of the game - Add icons
- [x] Bugfixing / Debugging villagers movement issues - [X] #1 🐛 Villagers are overlapping one with eachother when crowded. - Maybe we can create some simplified test? To see if it's because of Arcade physics and find possible solutions. - More difficult to reproduce probably since we started using `physics.move` method. - Still happened, though... And can't find a way to reproduce. - After talking on Discord with @samme it seems like my initial guess was right. It seems a limitation on how Arcade Physics resolve collisions. They rely on a "Projection Method" which does not take into account any other collision. The only suggestion is to move to MatterJS physiscs engine. - Some MatterJS + Phaser3 tutorial [here][2] - [X] #2 🐛 Villagers moving infinitely upon collision - Set villagers as inmovable didn't work. Because when two bodies are immovable they won't collide (which kind-of makes sense). - Setting `drag` fixed the issue. But we spent a lot of time trying to set it up because we missunderstood the value passed to the `setDrag` method, it's not a percentage but an amount of pixel. - [X] #4 🐛 Villager might get into an unknown status when trying to gather resource and resource is destroyed. It was detected while doing a quick test by generating many villagers and sending them to consume the same resource. All of them behaved correctly (going back to initial position) except from one, which was "stuck" close to the already non-existent resource. ⚠️ This might be related to #3. - [X] #3 🐛 Villagers getting "stuck" while consuming resource. Not consuming and not moving. Maybe there is a gap between them and the resource but the movement is not getting them closer? - Increased the marging to consider an object as "closer" as possible to another one.
- [x] Moving to MatterJS physics engine
- [x] Add reference to Phaser3 in README.
- [x] Main Building / Villagers creation - Display actions popup. - Add button to create villager. - Make villager creation to cost resource and time - Avoid villagers stacking / overlapping on creation - Show basic info on villagers enqueued for creation - extra ball: show villager creation progress info

- [x] Increase "drag" for villagers upon receiving a collision - using setFrictionAir
- [x] Slow down the collecting action
- [x] Refactoring villagers code preparing for enemies creation - Reduce `.target` and `.destination` entities into a single one. - Delegated the margin calculation to the `.target` object. - Extracted the if/else construction for movement to a separate method. - Extracted all movement related methods to a separated `movement.js`
- [x] GUI revamp - Use smaller icons (currently 512x512, which is too big) - Get an icon for time
- [x] Review if we can use `setFriction` instead of `setFrictionAir` - we can not
