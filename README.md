# Unnamed RTS
Open-source RTS game inspired by Age Of Empires II but much simpler.

## What is this?
This is a game I will use to learn game development. The initial idea is very basic but I intend to construct it in a way that allows me for many further improvements and evolutions.

## Game concept
You can check the concept of the game on this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VEOTnC9N4-9KWOarlTR5_SHRbzlGuOpvtSXMWkIF8vs/edit?usp=sharing).
